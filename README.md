# About this repository

- This repository is a template i currently use for static html 
        pages + some otherprojects with both django (for python) 
        and actix (for rust) i currrently am working on. This just 
        barely includes a html file with a basic html quickstart, 
        some javascript libraries like HTMX and Jquery, and bulma 
        CSS for quick and easy front end developing and easy 
        maintainability.
